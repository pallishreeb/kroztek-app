You can access your cloud equipment and manage them from anywhere in the world with an internet capable device. For customers with many locations, you can have one single sign-on making it easy to manage all of your locations. Faster application velocity, you can begin deployment immediately and deploy apps quickly. With cloud solutions your firmware will always be up to date with automatic updating, which eliminates the need for constant basic maintenance, and even worrying about changes in technology making your traditional software obsolete.",
